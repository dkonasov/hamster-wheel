# Hamster wheel

## What is Hamster wheel?

Hamster wheel is an application for managing your pet projects. It's a bit more complicated than simple todo app, and allows you to manage different set of tasks (or todo items) for different projects.

## Supported platforms

Currently only Mac (Intel and M1 chips) is supported. However, you can build app for your platform, as far as Hamster wheel is a typical Electron app =)
